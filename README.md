# Support Vector Machine
-**[general_mpi_dual_decomposition.py](https://github.com/anto6715/svm/blob/master/general_mpi_dual_decomposition.py "general_mpi_dual_decomposition.py")** is an implementations of the support vector machine algorithm solved by dual decomposition method,

-**[svm_dual_decomposition_mpi_diminishing.py](https://github.com/anto6715/svm/blob/master/svm_dual_decomposition_mpi_diminishing.py "svm_dual_decomposition_mpi_diminishing.py")** instead is the previous algorithm but implemented in mpi library
